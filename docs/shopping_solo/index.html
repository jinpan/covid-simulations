<p>Covid-19 has spread across our planet at a rapid pace, infecting
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html">4.4 million+ people
worldwide</a>,
with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html">1.4 million+ cases in the United States as of mid-May
2020</a>.
Until a vaccine is broadly administered, society must continue working together to
control the infection rate.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of small decisions we make each day that
collectively contribute to the infection rate - should I wear a mask?
Should I go shopping solo? Should I wear my lucky socks? Do my
decisions even matter?</p>

<p>While there are definitive answers to some questions (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">The CDC recommends
everyone to wear a mask
outdoors</a>),
others are harder to answer.  To answer the harder questions, let’s
simulate how a hypothetical virus spreads across a virtual population.</p>

<p>First, let’s simulate the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model">Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered</a>
model.  Green circles represent <span style="background-color: #B8F7BF">susceptible</span> people, red <span style="background-color: #EB6383">infectious</span>, and gray <span style="background-color: #C8C8C8">recovered</span>.  A susceptible person who gets too close to an
infectious person will catch the disease.</p>

  <canvas id="radius_brownian0-canvas" width="600" height="400" style="border:1px solid #000000; width:100%">
  </canvas>
</div>

<p>The infected population initially grows rapidly but slows as the susceptible
population shrinks, and eventually the virus runs out of people to infect. In
this rough model, the pandemic is over with 70+% of the population infected.</p>

<p>We can improve this initial simulation by more realistically modelling</p>
<ol>
  <li>Virus Spread</li>
  <li>Human Behavior</li>
</ol>

<p>We will use the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SEIR_model">Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered</a>
model, a more realistic model of disease spread.  People are
<span style="background-color: #C7BA29">exposed</span>
for one third as long as they are infectious, which is the estimated ratio
for Covid-19
<a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf">according to the WHO</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of spreading via contact, the disease will be spread through viral particles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Infectious people emit viral particles by breathing, coughing, sneezing, etc</li>
  <li>People continuously inhale viral particles; the more particles they breathe, the
more likely they are to be exposed to the disease</li>
  <li>Viral particles fade over time</li>
</ul>

<p>We are not always trapped in a giant bouncy castle.  Next, let’s simulate
more realistic human behavior - shopping.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="shopping-simulation">Shopping Simulation</h3>

<p>Let’s simulate a tiny community of 108 people split among 54 households (2 people
per household).  All people are social distancing, but households must
periodically make trips to the store as they run out of supplies.</p>

<p>Some households (marked <code class="highlighter-rouge">1x</code>) have a 1x shopper rule that only one person goes
shopping, and other households (marked as <code class="highlighter-rouge">2x</code>), both people will go out to
shop and stick together in the store. See this footnote for all parameters
<sup id="fnref:shopping_parameters"><a href="#fn:shopping_parameters" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You can configure the percentage of 2x shopper households and observe how that affects
disease spread.</p>

    <button class="particle_shopper0-pct-dual-shopper" data-pct="100">100%</button>
  </span>

  <br />
  <div id="particle_shopper0-uplot" style="border: solid; border-width: thin; display: inline-block; width:100%"></div>

  <canvas id="particle_shopper0-canvas" width="600" height="400" style="border:1px solid #000000; width:100%">
  </canvas>
</div>

<hr />

<p>Running this simulation tens of thousands of times, we see that a 1% increase in
2x-shopper households leads to a ~0.96% increase in people infected at the end of
the simulations.</p>

<div id="infection_rate_vs_pct_dual_shopper" style="border: solid; border-width: thin; display: inline-block"></div>

<p>The dotted line is the median infection rate across the entire population,
given a certain percentage of 2x-shopper households. The shaded gray area
contains the average 50% of outcomes across all the simulations.</p>

<p>Single shopper households are already sending out 1 shopper to buy supplies
periodically. In this community, if a 1x-shopper household were to convert
to a 2x-shopper household, they risk infecting <code class="highlighter-rouge">(1/54) * 0.96 * 108 = 1.92</code>
more people on average (there is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">1/54</code> increase in number of 2x-shopper
households, which we multiply by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.96</code> slope of the graph to get the
percentage increase of infected people, which we then scale by the total number
of people <code class="highlighter-rouge">108</code> to get an absolute number of additional infected people). In
other words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each additional shopper infects 1.9 more people on average.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yes, our decisions absolutely matter and they can matter beyond ourselves.</p>

<hr />

<p>We can also look at the same data from a household-level perspective and address
the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does imposing a 1x-shopper rule in <em>my</em> household affect the risk of
someone in <em>my</em> household getting the disease?</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="infection_rate_by_household_type_vs_pct_dual_shopper" style="border: solid; border-width: thin; display: inline-block"></div>

<p>The shaded green region represents the average 50% of outcomes for
1x-shopper households, and the red region for 2x-shopper households.
Initially infected households were excluded from this data for fairness.</p>

<p>Our decisions do not exist in a vacuum, and our rate of infection
depends on others within our community. What is interesting here is that
our decisions matter more when our community is more at risk - the gap between
household infection rates is greatest when there are many 2x-shopper households
in the community.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our decisions matter more when our community is more at risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>While we tuned many parameters of our hypothetical virus simulation to
mimic the rate of spread of covid-19, this hypothetical virus is not covid-19
(and there still remains much to be learned about the exact mechanisms of how
it spreads) and the simulated circles do not capture real human behavior
(we order grocery delivery services, maintain distance in stores, squeeze many
avocados on the shelf to find the ripest ones, and so on).  So please wrap the
above numbers with generous error bars when applying those judgements in your
daily activities.</p>

<p>On the other hand, building high quality models/simulations and making informed
decisions based on them is the best way to combat this virus as a society.  The
cost of rigorous field studies can often be too expensive (both in terms of
time and infections), so improving these simulations and making policy off of
them may be better than the alternative of waiting for field data.</p>

<h2 id="call-for-help">Call for help:</h2>
<p>I am a software engineer, not an epidemiologist.  If you are an epidemiologist
(or know of one), please get in touch at <code class="highlighter-rouge">covid-contact@simrnd.com</code>.  I would
like to build more simulations to model how our behavior affects the disease
spread and want these simulations to be calibrated against everything we know
about covid-19.</p>

<p>Also, please consider sharing these simulations if you found them informative -
let’s work together to spread high quality information and control the spread of
the virus.</p>

      <p>Shopping simulation parameters:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>At 1x speed, each second is divided into 60 ticks.  At 2x speed, each second into 120 ticks, and so on.</li>
        <li>The map is a 600 x 400 grid.</li>
        <li>Within households and stores, people will move at 1 unit per tick, and bounce off of walls.</li>
        <li>On roads, people will move at 3 units per tick and take the shortest path from their household to the store
and vice versa.</li>
        <li>Households randomly start with 150-450 supplies, and consume 1 supply per tick.  This is independent of how many
people are in the household at that time.</li>
        <li>Households go shopping when the supply level hits 0.  However, the supply level will continue
dropping by 1 per tick and go negative.</li>
        <li>1x-shopper households will send out the same person each time they go shopping.</li>
        <li>At the store, 2x-shopper households stick together.</li>
        <li>Both types of households will spend 600 ticks at the store, not including time to travel to/from
the store.  Travel time depends on household distance to the store.</li>
        <li>Both types of households will buy 1800 supplies from the store and add them to the household supply levels.  This
is 1800 per household, <em>not</em> per person.</li>
        <li>Infectious people exhale 1 particle in a circle of radius 9 around them on the grid, once per tick</li>
        <li>People only inhale particles for the grid point that they are on.</li>
        <li>When a susceptible person inhales N particles, they have a N * 0.013% chance of becoming exposed during on that
tick.  They do not accumulate inhaled particles - each tick is independent of the previous.</li>
        <li>When initially exposed, people stay exposed for 900 ticks and become infectious for 2700 ticks before recovering.</li>
        <li>Each tick, the number of particles at each location on the grid decays by 5.5%</li>
