<p>Covid-19 has been spreading across our planet at a rapid pace, infecting
more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html">4.4 million people
worldwide</a>,
with more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html">1.4 million cases in the United States as of mid-May
2020</a>.
Until a vaccine is broadly administered, society must work together to control
the infection rate.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of small decisions we all must make each day that
collectively contribute to the infection rate - should I wear a mask? How far away
should I keep from others? How often should I go shopping? Should I go
shopping solo? Should I wear my lucky socks? Do my decisions even matter?</p>

<p>While there are definitive answers to some questions (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">The CDC recommends
everyone to wear a mask
outdoors</a>),
others are harder to answer.  To answer some of the harder questions, let’s look
at some simulations of how a hypothetical virus spreads across a virtual
population and how individual actions affect the spread, both on a societal and
household level.</p>

<p>First, let’s simulate the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model">Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered</a>
model.  Green circles represent <span style="background-color: #B8F7BF">susceptible</span> people, red circles <span style="background-color: #EB6383">infectious</span> , and gray circles <span style="background-color: #C8C8C8">recovered</span> .  If a susceptible person gets too close to an
infectious person, they will catch the disease.</p>

  <canvas id="radius_brownian0-canvas" width="600" height="400" style="border:1px solid #000000;">
  </canvas>
</div>

<p>The infected population initially grows rapidly but slows as the susceptible
population shrinks.  Eventually the virus runs out of people to infect, and the
pandemic is over with 70+% of the population infected.</p>

<p>We can improve this initial simulation in two major ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>More realistically model the spread of the virus</li>
  <li>More realistically model human behavior - we are not always trapped in a giant
bouncy castle</li>
</ol>

<p>To more realistically model the spread of the virus, we’ll add viral particles
to the simulation: infectious people will continuously emit viral particles
(by breathing, coughing, sneezing, etc).  People will also continuously inhale
viral particles, and the more particles they breathe in, the more likely they
are to contract the disease.  Viral particles will fade over time.</p>

<p>Additionally, let’s use a more realistic model of disease spread - the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SEIR_model">Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered</a>
model.  This model introduces an <span style="background-color: #C7BA29">exposed</span> state, where exposed individuals are not immediately
infectious.  The WHO <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf">estimates that the Covid-19 exposed duration is about one
third as long as the infectious
duration</a>,
so we will use that ratio below.</p>

</div>

<p>Now that we have a more realistic model of how the virus spreads, let’s look at
simulating more realistic human behavior.</p>

<p>For the next simulation, we have a tiny community of 108 people split among 54
households (2 people per household).  These people are social distancing and
not seeing their friends and neighbors, but must periodically make trips to the
store as their toilet paper and other household supplies run out.</p>

<p>Some households have a single-shopper rule that only one person goes shopping,
and they are marked as “1x”.  In other households (marked as “2x”), both people
will go out to shop when supplies run out.</p>

<p>You can configure the percentage of single-shopper households and see how quickly
the disease spreads across the community at various percentages.  This simulation
takes longer to play out, so you may consider increasing the simulation speed.</p>

  <br />
  <span>Percent of dual shopper households:

    <button class="particle_shopper0-pct-dual-shopper" data-pct="75">75%</button>
    <button class="particle_shopper0-pct-dual-shopper" data-pct="100">100%</button>
  </span>

  <br />
  <div id="particle_shopper0-uplot" style="border: solid; border-width: thin; display: inline-block"></div>

  <canvas id="particle_shopper0-canvas" width="600" height="400" style="border:1px solid #000000;">
  </canvas>
</div>

<hr />

<p>If we run this simulation tens of thousands of times, we will see that
every 1% increase in dual-shopper households leads to approximately a
0.96% increase in people infected at the end of the simulations.</p>

<div id="infection_rate_vs_pct_dual_shopper" style="border: solid; border-width: thin; display: inline-block"></div>

<p>The dotted line is the median infection rate across the entire population,
given a certain percentage of dual-shopper households. The shaded gray area
contains the average 50% of outcomes across all the simulations.</p>

<p>Single shopper households are already sending out 1 shopper to buy supplies
periodically. In this community, if a single-shopper household were to convert
to a dual-shopper household, they risk infecting <code class="highlighter-rouge">(1/54) * 0.96 * 108 = 1.92</code>
more people on average (there is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">1/54</code> increase in number of dual-shopper
households, which we multiply by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.96</code> slope of the graph to get the
percentage increase of infected people, which we then scale by the total number
of people <code class="highlighter-rouge">108</code> to get an absolute number of additional infected people). In
other words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each additional shopper infects 1.92 more people on average.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yes, our decisions absolutely matter and they can matter beyond ourselves.</p>

<hr />

<p>We can also look at the same data from a household-level perspective and tackle
the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does imposing a single-shopper rule in <em>my</em> household affect the risk of
someone in <em>my</em> household getting the disease?</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="infection_rate_by_household_type_vs_pct_dual_shopper" style="border: solid; border-width: thin; display: inline-block"></div>

<p>The shaded green region represents the average 50% of outcomes for
single-shopper households, and the red region for dual-shopper households.
Initially infected households were excluded from this data for fairness.</p>

<p>As the data shows, our decisions do not exist in a vacuum - our rate of infection
depends on others within our community. What is interesting here is that
our decisions matter most when our community is most at risk - the gap between
household infection rates is greatest when there are many dual-shopper households
in the community.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our decisions matter most when our community is most at risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>While we tuned many parameters of our hypothetical virus simulation to
mimic the rate of spread of covid-19, this hypothetical virus is not covid-19
(and there still remains much to be learned about the exact mechanisms of how
it spreads) and the simulated circles do not capture real human behavior
(we order grocery delivery services, maintain distance in stores, squeeze many
avocados on the shelf to find the ripest ones, and so on).  So please wrap the
above numbers with generous error bars when applying those judgements in your
daily activities.</p>

<p>On the other hand, building high quality models/simulations and making informed
decisions based on them is the best way to combat this virus as a society.  The
cost of rigorous field studies can often be too expensive (both in terms of
time and infections), so improving these simulations and making policy off of
them may be better than the alternative of waiting for field data.</p>

<p>I am a software engineer, not an epidemiologist.  If you are an epidemiologist
(or know of one), please get in touch at <code class="highlighter-rouge">covid-contact@simrnd.com</code>.  I would
like to build more simulations to model how our behavior affects the disease
spread and want these simulations to be calibrated against everything we know
about covid-19.</p>
