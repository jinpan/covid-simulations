This site hosts interactive simulations on the spread of SARS-CoV-2.  The goal is to better inform readers about how the
virus spreads, and highlight what actions they can take to effectively keep themselves and their community safer.

Specifically, the following outcomes would make this site a success:
* Saving a life
* Empowering decision-makers to make more informed policies
* Informing the public to help them keep their families and communities safer

We believe that high-fidelity simulations are critical to helping find a balance between keeping society safe and the
economy productive.  Not only can they help decision-makers analyze the tradeoffs of various decisions, they can also
make expert models accessible to the public, helping us all understand the rationale behind the decisions.

These simulations are all open sourced at 
[github.com/jinpan/covid-simulations](https://github.com/jinpan/covid-simulations).
